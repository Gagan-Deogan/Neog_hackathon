 >### Some Context 

We create a lot of information when we speak to someone live.  If that voice is not preserved, that is lost. Another issue with voice is that it isn't searchable or bookmarkable, and you can't skip to a specific part of a conversation without transcription. So we devised a solution by building a Clubhouse  but for texts: **GupShupp** :grinning:
